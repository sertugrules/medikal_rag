What are the genetic changes related to leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation ?,Uzun,256,2164,2420,"The genetic changes related to leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (also known as LBSL) are associated with mutations in the DARS2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, which is involved in protein synthesis. Mutations in the DARS2 gene lead to impaired enzyme function, resulting in the characteristic symptoms of LBSL, including progressive brain damage, spasticity, and elevated lactate levels."
What to do for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis ?,Orta,55,1613,1668,"Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic liver disease characterized by the progressive destruction of the bile ducts within the liver. The treatment for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis is primarily focused on managing the symptoms, slowing the progression of the disease, and preventing complications.

The main treatment for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis includes:

1. **Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)**: This medication is the first-line treatment for PBC and has been shown to improve liver function, reduce symptoms, and slow the progression of the disease.
2. **Immunosuppressive medications**: In some cases, immunosuppressive medications such as corticosteroids or azathioprine may be prescribed to reduce inflammation and slow the progression of the disease.
3. **Management of symptoms**: Treatment of symptoms such as itching, fatigue, and jaundice may include medications such as antihistamines, bile acid sequestrants, and vitamin supplements.
4. **Liver transplantation**: In advanced cases of PBC, liver transplantation may be necessary to replace the damaged liver with a healthy one.

It's essential to note that the treatment for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis is individualized and may vary depending on the severity of the disease, the presence of complications, and the patient's overall health. Regular monitoring and follow-up with a healthcare provider are crucial to manage the disease effectively."
Who is at risk for Fecal Incontinence? ?,Orta,54,1971,2025,"Based on the provided context, it appears that the discussion is focused on urinary incontinence rather than fecal incontinence. However, I can provide general information on who is at risk for fecal incontinence.

Fecal incontinence can affect anyone, but certain individuals are at a higher risk. These include:

1. Older adults: Age-related changes, such as weakened anal sphincter muscles and decreased rectal sensation, can increase the risk of fecal incontinence.
2. Women who have experienced childbirth: Vaginal delivery, particularly if it involved instrumental assistance (e.g., forceps) or severe perineal tears, can damage the anal sphincter muscles and increase the risk of fecal incontinence.
3. Individuals with certain medical conditions: Conditions like diabetes, stroke, spinal cord injuries, and neurological disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease) can affect bowel function and increase the risk of fecal incontinence.
4. People with a history of pelvic surgery or radiation: Certain surgeries, such as those involving the rectum or anus, and radiation therapy to the pelvic area can damage the anal sphincter muscles and increase the risk of fecal incontinence.
5. Individuals with gastrointestinal disorders: Conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome, and gastrointestinal infections can increase the risk of fecal incontinence.

It's essential to note that fecal incontinence can be managed and treated. If you or someone you know is experiencing fecal incontinence, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and guidance."
What is (are) Pervasive Developmental Disorders ?,Orta,49,1429,1478,"Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDDs) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by delays in the development of socialization and communication skills. Autism is a type of Pervasive Developmental Disorder. 

The five disorders classified under PDDs are:

1. Autism (also known as Autistic Disorder)
2. Asperger's Syndrome
3. Rett Syndrome
4. Childhood Disintegrative Disorder
5. Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS)

These disorders are called ""pervasive"" because they affect multiple areas of development, including social interaction, communication, and behavior. They are typically diagnosed in early childhood and can have a significant impact on a child's ability to interact with others and navigate their environment."
What are the symptoms of Crome syndrome ?,Orta,51,1507,1558,"The text doesn't mention ""Crome syndrome."" It actually talks about Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), which is also known by many other names, such as myalgic encephalomyelitis, low natural killer cell disease, post-viral syndrome, Epstein-Barr disease, and Yuppie flu.

Is nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly inherited ?,Orta,55,1607,1662,"Nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but it can also occur sporadically. However, in some cases, it may be related to uniparental disomy, where a person receives two copies of a chromosome from one parent, rather than one from each parent. This can lead to abnormal inheritance patterns, including the possibility of inheriting an autosomal recessive disorder, such as holoprosencephaly, even if only one parent is a carrier.

Additionally, chromosomal translocations, which involve the exchange of chromosomal parts between chromosomes, can also increase the risk of holoprosencephaly. However, not all cases of nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly are due to these genetic mechanisms, and the exact cause and inheritance pattern may vary from case to case.

It's worth noting that genetic counseling and testing can help determine the underlying cause of holoprosencephaly and assess the risk of recurrence in a family. If you have concerns about holoprosencephaly or any other genetic condition, it's best to consult with a genetic counselor or a medical professional for personalized advice and guidance."
How to prevent Balance Problems ?,Orta,44,1960,2004,"To prevent balance problems, especially in the elderly, several strategies can be employed:

1. **Exercise and Physical Activity**: Regular exercise, such as walking, can help improve overall physical fitness and reduce the risk of falls. Specific exercises that challenge balance, such as tai chi, can be particularly beneficial.

2. **Balance Training**: While balance training may have its limitations, as you mentioned, it can still be helpful for some individuals. This includes activities that challenge balance in various environments, like standing on one leg or using balance boards.

3. **Environmental Modifications**: Making the home environment safer can prevent falls. This includes removing tripping hazards, improving lighting, installing handrails in strategic locations, and using non-slip mats in the bathroom.

4. **Vision Correction**: Ensuring that vision is corrected with appropriate glasses or contact lenses can help prevent falls, as poor vision can significantly impair balance and increase the risk of tripping.

5. **Medication Review**: Certain medications can affect balance and increase the risk of falls. Reviewing medications with a healthcare provider and adjusting them as necessary can help mitigate this risk.

6. **Vitamin D and Calcium Supplementation**: Maintaining strong bones through adequate vitamin D and calcium intake can help prevent osteoporosis, which can contribute to an increased risk of falls due to fractures.

7. **Regular Health Check-Ups**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider can help identify any underlying conditions that may be contributing to balance problems, such as neurological issues or inner ear problems, and allow for early intervention.

8. **Physical Therapy**: For individuals with specific balance impairments, physical therapy can provide customized exercises and strategies to improve balance and reduce the risk of falls.

By incorporating these strategies, individuals can take proactive steps to prevent balance problems and reduce their risk of falls."

However, it does discuss various types of myoclonic disorders, including myoclonic epilepsies (such as infantile spasms) and benign essential myoclonus.

Benign essential myoclonus is mentioned as often being autosomal dominant, which implies a genetic inheritance pattern. However, without more specific information about ""myoclonic epilepsy myopathy sensory ataxia"", it's difficult to say whether this particular condition is inherited.

If you're referring to a specific condition, such as myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF) or Unverricht-Lundborg disease, these conditions are indeed inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern, respectively. But more information would be needed to provide a definitive answer."
What is (are) Menkes Disease ?,Orta,57,1724,1781,"Menkes disease is a rare, inherited disorder that affects copper levels in the body. It is also known as ""kinky hair disease"" due to the characteristic kinky or curly hair of affected individuals.

Menkes disease is caused by a mutation in the ATP7A gene, which provides instructions for making a protein that plays a crucial role in the transport of copper from the gut into the bloodstream and then to the brain and other tissues. As a result, copper is not absorbed properly, leading to a deficiency of this essential mineral.

The symptoms of Menkes disease typically appear in early infancy and may include:

* Kinky or curly hair
* Failure to thrive
* Poor muscle tone
* Seizures
* Delayed development
* Vision and hearing loss

If left untreated, Menkes disease can lead to serious complications, such as:

* Brain damage

* Vision and hearing loss
* Poor growth and development

There is no cure for Menkes disease, but early treatment with copper injections may help alleviate some symptoms and slow disease progression. However, the prognosis for individuals with Menkes disease is generally poor, and most affected children do not survive beyond early childhood.

It's worth noting that the text you provided does not mention Menkes disease. The information I provided is based on general medical knowledge."
What are the genetic changes related to hereditary multiple osteochondromas ?,Uzun,60,1522,1582,"Hereditary multiple osteochondromas (HMO), also known as hereditary multiple exostoses, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the growth of multiple osteochondromas (benign bone tumors) near the ends of bones.

The genetic changes related to HMO are typically mutations in one of two genes: 

1. **EXT1 (exostosin 1) gene**: Located on chromosome 8, this gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in the development and growth of bones and cartilage.
2. **EXT2 (exostosin 2) gene**: Located on chromosome 11, this gene also provides instructions for making a protein involved in bone and cartilage development.

These mutations disrupt the normal function of the EXT1 and EXT2 proteins, leading to abnormal bone growth and the formation of osteochondromas. The mutations can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition."
How many people are affected by Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease ?,Uzun,61,1283,1344,"The text doesn't mention the number of people affected by Acquired Cystic Kidney Disease.

What is (are) Oculodentodigital dysplasia ?,Orta,65,1877,1942,"Oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the eyes, teeth, and fingers. It is characterized by a combination of abnormalities in these areas, including:

* Eye abnormalities: microphthalmia (small eyes), coloboma (a hole in one of the structures of the eye), and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements)
* Dental abnormalities: missing or abnormal teeth, enamel hypoplasia (underdeveloped tooth enamel), and dental caries
* Digital abnormalities: syndactyly (webbed fingers or toes), camptodactyly (bent fingers), and clinodactyly (curved fingers)

ODDD is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition. The disorder is caused by mutations in the GJA1 gene, which codes for a protein called connexin 43. This protein is important for the formation of gap junctions, which allow cells to communicate with each other.

In addition to the characteristic eye, tooth, and finger abnormalities, individuals with ODDD may also experience other symptoms, such as:

* Hearing loss
* Craniofacial abnormalities
* Skin abnormalities
* Neurological problems, such as seizures or intellectual disability

There is no cure for ODDD, but treatment can help manage the symptoms and improve the quality of life for individuals with the condition. This may include surgery to correct dental or eye abnormalities, as well as physical therapy to improve hand function and mobility."
What is (are) Acquired hemophilia ?,Orta,57,1681,1738,"Acquired hemophilia refers to a rare bleeding disorder characterized by the development of autoantibodies against a specific clotting factor, most commonly factor VIII. This condition is not inherited, but rather develops later in life, often in association with other medical conditions, such as autoimmune disorders, cancer, or certain medications.

In acquired hemophilia, the body's immune system mistakenly produces antibodies against its own clotting factors, leading to a deficiency of these factors and resulting in bleeding complications. The condition can manifest with similar symptoms to congenital hemophilia, including prolonged bleeding, bruising, and joint pain.

Acquired hemophilia can be further divided into two main types:

1. Acquired hemophilia A: This is the most common type, where autoantibodies are directed against factor VIII.
2. Acquired hemophilia B: This is a rare type, where autoantibodies are directed against factor IX.

Treatment for acquired hemophilia typically involves a combination of measures to control bleeding, suppress the immune system, and eliminate the autoantibodies. Replacement of the deficient clotting factor, as well as immunosuppressive therapy, may be necessary to manage the condition."
what types of infections does vancomycin-resistant enterococci cause?,Orta,62,2675,2737,"Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) can cause a variety of infections, particularly in hospitalized patients. Some common types of infections caused by VRE include:

1. **Nosocomial infections**: VRE can colonize the gut and cause infections in patients who are hospitalized, especially those with weakened immune systems or underlying medical conditions.
2. **Endocarditis**: As mentioned, if Enterococcus faecalis (a type of VRE) is found in blood culture, it is assumed to be endocarditis until proven otherwise. Endocarditis is a serious infection of the heart valves.
3. **Bloodstream infections**: VRE can cause bacteremia, which is a bloodstream infection that can be life-threatening if left untreated.
4. **Urinary tract infections**: VRE can cause urinary tract infections, particularly in patients with catheters or other medical devices.
5. **Surgical site infections**: VRE can cause infections at surgical sites, especially in patients who have undergone abdominal or pelvic surgery.

It's essential to seek expert help when dealing with VRE infections, as they can be challenging to treat due to their resistance to vancomycin and other antibiotics."
What is (are) Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease ?,Orta,56,2694,2750,"Actually, the text provided is about Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD). However, I can provide information on Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease (ARPKD) for you.

Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease (ARPKD) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the kidneys and liver. It is caused by a mutation in the PKHD1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition.

ARPKD is characterized by the growth of numerous fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys, which can lead to kidney enlargement and impaired kidney function. The disease can also affect the liver, causing fibrosis and other complications.

Symptoms of ARPKD may include:

* Enlarged kidneys
* Kidney failure
* Liver disease
* High blood pressure
* Hematuria (blood in the urine)

Diagnosis of ARPKD is typically made through a combination of imaging tests, such as ultrasound and CT scans, as well as genetic testing.

Is diastrophic dysplasia inherited ?,Orta,61,2431,2492,"The text provided does not mention diastrophic dysplasia. It appears to be discussing restrictive cardiomyopathy and its consequences, including diastolic dysfunction and potential complications. 

However, I can provide information on diastrophic dysplasia. Diastrophic dysplasia is a rare genetic disorder that affects bone and cartilage development. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition. Carriers of the mutated gene, who have one normal and one mutated copy, typically do not exhibit symptoms but can pass the mutated gene to their offspring."
What is (are) Long QT syndrome ?,Orta,58,2516,2574,"Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a condition that affects the heart's electrical system, specifically the repolarization phase. It is characterized by a prolongation of the QT interval, which can predispose individuals to arrhythmias, particularly torsades de pointes, due to early after-depolarizations and spatial dispersion of refractoriness.

There are at least 10 distinct forms of congenital Long QT syndrome, with the most common ones being:

1. Long QT syndrome type 1 (LQT1): caused by a loss of function mutation of the KCNQ1 gene, which encodes an adrenergic-sensitive cardiac K current (I_Ks).

In general, Long QT syndrome can be congenital (inherited) or acquired (caused by certain medications, electrolyte imbalances, or other medical conditions). It is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires proper diagnosis and treatment to prevent sudden cardiac death."

What is (are) autosomal dominant hypocalcemia ?,Orta,54,2510,2564,"Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH) refers to a rare genetic disorder characterized by low calcium levels in the blood (hypocalcemia) due to mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the disorder.

In ADH, the CaSR gene mutation leads to an overactive calcium-sensing receptor, which causes the parathyroid glands to be overly sensitive to calcium levels. As a result, the parathyroid glands produce less parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to hypocalcemia.

ADH is often asymptomatic, but some individuals may experience symptoms such as muscle cramps, tingling, or seizures due to low calcium levels. Treatment for ADH typically involves managing hypocalcemia with calcium and vitamin D supplements."

Is heterotaxy syndrome inherited ?,Orta,59,1669,1728,"Heterotaxy syndrome is a complex condition that involves abnormalities in the arrangement of organs in the body. While it can be inherited in some cases, it is not always the case.

Research suggests that heterotaxy syndrome can be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some people with heterotaxy syndrome may have a family history of the condition, which suggests that there may be a genetic component. However, many cases of heterotaxy syndrome occur sporadically, without a known family history.

In some cases, heterotaxy syndrome has been linked to genetic mutations or chromosomal abnormalities, such as uniparental disomy or chromosomal translocation. For example, uniparental disomy, where a person receives two copies of a chromosome from the same parent, can increase the risk of heterotaxy syndrome. Additionally, chromosomal translocations, which involve the exchange of genetic material between chromosomes, can also contribute to the development of heterotaxy syndrome.

It's estimated that about 10-20% of cases of heterotaxy syndrome are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition. However, the majority of cases are thought to be sporadic, and the exact causes are still not fully understood.

If you have a family history of heterotaxy syndrome or are concerned about your risk of developing the condition, it's best to speak with a genetic counselor or a healthcare professional for personalized advice and guidance."

What is (are) Afibrinogenemia ?,Orta,55,2914,2969,"Afibrinogenemia is a rare bleeding disorder characterized by the complete absence or very low levels of fibrinogen in the blood. Fibrinogen is a protein that plays a crucial role in blood clotting, and its deficiency can lead to impaired coagulation and increased risk of bleeding.

In afibrinogenemia, the body is unable to form clots properly, which can result in prolonged or spontaneous bleeding. The condition is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a person must inherit two defective genes (one from each parent) to develop the disorder.

Symptoms of afibrinogenemia may include:

* Easy bruising
* Prolonged bleeding after injury or surgery
* Spontaneous bleeding (e.g., nosebleeds, bleeding gums)
* Heavy menstrual bleeding in women
* Increased risk of bleeding during pregnancy or childbirth

Diagnosis of afibrinogenemia is typically made through laboratory tests, including:

* Fibrinogen level tests
* Coagulation studies (e.g., prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time)
* Platelet function tests

Treatment for afibrinogenemia usually involves replacing fibrinogen through transfusions or administering fibrinogen concentrates to help control bleeding. In some cases, fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate may also be used to provide fibrinogen."

What are the stages of Breast Cancer ?,Orta,53,3003,3056,"The stages of breast cancer are typically classified into five stages, from 0 to IV, based on the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread to lymph nodes, and whether it has metastasized to other parts of the body. Here are the stages of breast cancer:

**Stage 0:** 
- Carcinoma in situ, which means the cancer is confined to the milk ducts or lobules and has not invaded surrounding tissue.
- No evidence of cancer cells breaking through the wall of the duct or lobule.

**Stage I:**
- The tumor is 2 centimeters (cm) or less in size and has not spread to lymph nodes.
- Cancer has not spread to other parts of the body.

**Stage II:**
- The tumor is 2-5 cm in size and may or may not have spread to nearby lymph nodes.
- Alternatively, the tumor is larger than 5 cm but has not spread to lymph nodes.

**Stage III:**
- The tumor is larger than 5 cm and has spread to nearby lymph nodes.
- Alternatively, the tumor is any size and has spread to lymph nodes and/or the chest wall or skin.

**Stage IV:**
- The cancer has spread (metastasized) to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver, brain, or bones.
- This is also known as metastatic breast cancer.

It's worth noting that within these stages, breast cancer can be further classified based on the presence or absence of certain biomarkers, such as estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). These biomarkers can influence treatment options and prognosis."
"What is (are) GM2-gangliosidosis, AB variant ?",Orta,55,2568,2623,"The AB variant of GM2-gangliosidosis is a rare form of the disease, also known as Sandhoff's disease. It is caused by a deficiency of both hexosaminidase A (Hex-A) and hexosaminidase B (Hex-B) enzymes, which are necessary for breaking down GM2 gangliosides in the brain.

In the AB variant, there is a mutation in the gene that codes for the beta-subunit of hexosaminidase, which is a shared subunit between Hex-A and Hex-B. As a result, both enzymes are deficient, leading to the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides in the brain and causing severe neurologic symptoms.

Sandhoff's disease is similar to Tay-Sachs disease, but it is more severe and has an earlier onset. It is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, seizures, and early death, usually in early childhood."
What is (are) keratoderma with woolly hair ?,Orta,63,2688,2751,"Keratoderma with woolly hair is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal hair shafts and skin thickening (keratoderma) on the palms and soles. It is often associated with woolly or fragile hair, particularly in infancy and early childhood. This condition can be further divided into several subtypes, including:

1. Naxos disease: A recessive disorder featuring woolly hair, keratoderma, and a high risk of cardiac problems.
2. Carvajal syndrome: A similar condition with woolly hair, keratoderma, and heart issues, but with a distinct set of genetic mutations.

Both conditions are extremely rare and often require a comprehensive evaluation, including genetic testing, to confirm the diagnosis."

Additionally, problems with taste can also be related to disorders of smell, as the two senses are physiologically interdependent."
What causes McCune Albright syndrome ?,Orta,79,2340,2419,"McCune-Albright syndrome is caused by a genetic mutation, specifically a single-gene mutation that occurs after fertilization, resulting in mosaicism. This means that the mutation is present in only some of the body's cells, rather than all of them. If the mutation were present in all cells, it would likely be fatal, but the presence of normal cells alongside the mutated cells allows individuals with mosaicism to survive."
What is (are) Hemifacial myohyperplasia ?,Orta,54,2875,2929,"Hemifacial myohyperplasia is not mentioned in the provided context. However, I can try to provide some general information about it.

Hemifacial myohyperplasia is a rare congenital condition characterized by an abnormal growth or overdevelopment of the muscles on one side of the face. This can lead to facial asymmetry, with the affected side appearing larger or more prominent than the other side.

The condition can be associated with other abnormalities, such as hemifacial microsomia, where there is underdevelopment of the bones and tissues on the same side of the face. In some cases, hemifacial myohyperplasia may be part of a larger syndrome, such as hemifacial hyperplasia, which can involve overgrowth of the skin, bones, and other tissues on one side of the face.

Treatment for hemifacial myohyperplasia may involve surgical procedures to correct the facial asymmetry and improve the appearance of the affected area. However, the specific treatment approach will depend on the individual case and the severity of the condition.
