    "question": "What are the genetic changes related to leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation ?",
    "model_answer": "The genetic changes related to leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (also known as LBSL) are associated with mutations in the DARS2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, which is involved in protein synthesis. Mutations in the DARS2 gene lead to impaired enzyme function, resulting in the characteristic symptoms of LBSL, including progressive brain damage, spasticity, and elevated lactate levels.",
    "ground_truth": "LBSL is caused by mutations in the DARS2 gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. This enzyme is important in the production (synthesis) of proteins in cellular structures called mitochondria, the energy-producing centers in cells. While most protein synthesis occurs in the fluid surrounding the nucleus (cytoplasm), some proteins are synthesized in the mitochondria.  During protein synthesis, in either the mitochondria or the cytoplasm, building blocks (amino acids) are connected together in a specific order, creating a chain of amino acids that forms the protein. Mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase plays a role in adding the amino acid aspartic acid at the proper place in mitochondrial proteins.  Mutations in the DARS2 gene result in decreased mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase enzyme activity, which hinders the addition of aspartic acid to mitochondrial proteins. It is unclear how the gene mutations lead to the signs and symptoms of LBSL. Researchers do not understand why reduced activity of mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase specifically affects certain parts of the brain and spinal cord."

    "question": "Is nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly inherited ?",
    "model_answer": "Nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but it can also occur sporadically. However, in some cases, it may be related to uniparental disomy, where a person receives two copies of a chromosome from one parent, rather than one from each parent. This can lead to abnormal inheritance patterns, including the possibility of inheriting an autosomal recessive disorder, such as holoprosencephaly, even if only one parent is a carrier.\n\nAdditionally, chromosomal translocations, which involve the exchange of chromosomal parts between chromosomes, can also increase the risk of holoprosencephaly. However, not all cases of nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly are due to these genetic mechanisms, and the exact cause and inheritance pattern may vary from case to case.\n\nIt's worth noting that genetic counseling and testing can help determine the underlying cause of holoprosencephaly and assess the risk of recurrence in a family. If you have concerns about holoprosencephaly or any other genetic condition, it's best to consult with a genetic counselor or a medical professional for personalized advice and guidance.",
    "ground_truth": "Nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means an alteration in one copy of a gene in each cell is usually sufficient to cause the disorder. However, not all people with a gene mutation will develop signs and symptoms of the condition.  In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one parent who may or may not have mild features of the condition. Other cases result from a new gene mutation and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family."

    "question": "How to prevent Balance Problems ?",
    "model_answer": "To prevent balance problems, especially in the elderly, several strategies can be employed:\n\n1. **Exercise and Physical Activity**: Regular exercise, such as walking, can help improve overall physical fitness and reduce the risk of falls. Specific exercises that challenge balance, such as tai chi, can be particularly beneficial.\n\n2. **Balance Training**: While balance training may have its limitations, as you mentioned, it can still be helpful for some individuals. This includes activities that challenge balance in various environments, like standing on one leg or using balance boards.\n\n3. **Environmental Modifications**: Making the home environment safer can prevent falls. This includes removing tripping hazards, improving lighting, installing handrails in strategic locations, and using non-slip mats in the bathroom.\n\n4. **Vision Correction**: Ensuring that vision is corrected with appropriate glasses or contact lenses can help prevent falls, as poor vision can significantly impair balance and increase the risk of tripping.\n\n5. **Medication Review**: Certain medications can affect balance and increase the risk of falls. Reviewing medications with a healthcare provider and adjusting them as necessary can help mitigate this risk.\n\n6. **Vitamin D and Calcium Supplementation**: Maintaining strong bones through adequate vitamin D and calcium intake can help prevent osteoporosis, which can contribute to an increased risk of falls due to fractures.\n\n7. **Regular Health Check-Ups**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider can help identify any underlying conditions that may be contributing to balance problems, such as inner ear issues or neurological conditions, and allow for early intervention.\n\n8. **Physical Therapy**: For individuals with specific balance impairments, working with a physical therapist can provide personalized exercises and strategies to improve balance and reduce the risk of falls.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, individuals can take proactive steps to prevent balance problems and reduce their risk of falls.",
    "ground_truth": "People are more likely to have problems with balance as they get older. But age is not the only reason these problems occur; there are other causes, too. In some cases, you can help reduce your risk for certain balance problems. Problems in the Inner Ear Some balance disorders are caused by problems in the inner ear. The part of the inner ear that is responsible for balance is the vestibular system, also known as the labyrinth. When the labyrinth becomes infected or swollen, this condition is called labyrinthitis. It is typically accompanied by vertigo and imbalance. Upper respiratory infections and other viral infections, and, less commonly, bacterial infections, can lead to labyrinthitis. Other Causes Other balance diseorers may involve another part of the body, such as the brain or the heart. For example, diseases of the circulatory system, such as stroke, can cause dizziness and other balance problems. Smoking and diabetes can increase the risk of stroke. Low blood pressure can also cause dizziness. Aging, infections, head injury and many medicines may also result in a balance problem. Problems Caused by Medications Balance problems can also result from taking many medications. For example, some medicines, such as those that help lower blood pressure, can make a person feel dizzy. Ototoxic drugs are medicines that damage the inner ear. If your medicine is ototoxic, you may feel off balance. Sometimes the damage lasts only as long as you take the drug; many times it is permanent. Groups of drugs that are more likely to be ototoxic include -  antidepressants  - anti-seizure drugs (anticonvulsants)  -  hypertensive (high blood pressure) drugs  - sedatives  - tranquilizers  -  anxiolytics (anti-anxiety drugs)   - aminoglycosides (a type of antibiotic)   - diuretics  - vasodilators  - certain analgesics (painkillers)  - certain chemotherapeutics (anti-cancer drugs). antidepressants anti-seizure drugs (anticonvulsants) hypertensive (high blood pressure) drugs sedatives tranquilizers anxiolytics (anti-anxiety drugs) aminoglycosides (a type of antibiotic) diuretics vasodilators certain analgesics (painkillers) certain chemotherapeutics (anti-cancer drugs). Check with your doctor if you notice a problem while taking a medication. Ask if other medications can be used instead. If not, ask if the dosage can be safely reduced. Sometimes it cannot. However, your doctor will help you get the medication you need while trying to reduce unwanted side effects. Diet and Lifestyle Can Help Your diet and lifestyle can help you manage certain balance-related problems. For example, Mnire's disease, which causes vertigo and other balance and hearing problems, is linked to a change in the volume of fluid in the inner ear. By eating low-salt (low-sodium) or salt-free foods, and steering clear of caffeine and alcohol, you may make Mnire's disease symptoms less severe. See suggestions for limiting salt (sodium) in your diet. Balance problems due to high blood pressure can be managed by eating less salt (less sodium), maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising. Balance problems due to low blood pressure may be managed by drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, avoiding alcohol, and being cautious regarding your body's posture and movement, such as standing up slowly and avoiding crossing your legs when youre seated. Learn more about managing high blood pressure (hypertension). Learn more about manging low blood pressure (hypotension). Prevent Ear Infections The ear infection called otitis media is common in children, but adults can get it too. Otitis media can sometimes cause dizziness. You can help prevent otitis media by washing your hands frequently. Also, talk to your doctor about getting a yearly flu shot to stave off flu-related ear infections. If you still get an ear infection, see a doctor immediately before it becomes more serious. Learn more about otitis media and other ear infections. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)"

    "question": "What is (are) Menkes Disease ?",
    "model_answer": "Menkes disease is a rare, inherited disorder that affects copper levels in the body. It is also known as \"kinky hair disease\" due to the characteristic kinky or curly hair of affected individuals.\n\nMenkes disease is caused by a mutation in the ATP7A gene, which provides instructions for making a protein that plays a crucial role in the transport of copper from the gut into the bloodstream and then to the brain and other tissues. As a result, copper is not absorbed properly, leading to a deficiency of this essential mineral.\n\nThe symptoms of Menkes disease typically appear in early infancy and may include:\n\n* Kinky or curly hair\n* Failure to thrive\n* Poor muscle tone\n* Seizures\n* Delayed development\n* Vision and hearing loss\n\nIf left untreated, Menkes disease can lead to serious complications, such as:\n\n* Brain damage\n* Seizures\n* Vision and hearing loss\n* Poor growth and development\n\nThere is no cure for Menkes disease, but early treatment with copper injections may help alleviate some symptoms and slow disease progression. However, the prognosis for individuals with Menkes disease is generally poor, and most affected children do not survive beyond early childhood.\n\nIt's worth noting that the text you provided does not mention Menkes disease. The information I provided is based on general medical knowledge.",
    "ground_truth": "Menkes disease is caused by a defective gene named ATPTA1 that regulates the metabolism of copper in the body. The disease primarily affects male infants. Copper accumulates at abnormally low levels in the liver and brain, but at higher than normal levels in the kidney and intestinal lining. Affected infants may be born prematurely, but appear healthy at birth and develop normally for 6 to 8 weeks. Then symptoms begin, including floppy muscle tone, seizures, and failure to thrive. Menkes disease is also characterized by subnormal body temperature and strikingly peculiar hair, which is kinky, colorless or steel-colored, and breaks easily. There is often extensive neurodegeneration in the gray matter of the brain. Arteries in the brain may be twisted with frayed and split inner walls. This can lead to rupture or blockage of the arteries. Weakened bones (osteoporosis) may result in fractures."

    "model_answer": "Hereditary multiple osteochondromas (HMO), also known as hereditary multiple exostoses, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the growth of multiple osteochondromas (benign bone tumors) near the ends of bones.\n\nThe genetic changes related to HMO are typically mutations in one of two genes: \n\n1. **EXT1 (exostosin 1) gene**: Located on chromosome 8, this gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in the development and growth of bones and cartilage.\n2. **EXT2 (exostosin 2) gene**: Located on chromosome 11, this gene also provides instructions for making a protein involved in bone and cartilage development.\n\nThese mutations disrupt the normal function of the EXT1 and EXT2 proteins, leading to abnormal bone growth and the formation of osteochondromas. The mutations can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition.",
    "ground_truth": "Mutations in the EXT1 and EXT2 genes cause hereditary multiple osteochondromas. The EXT1 gene and the EXT2 gene provide instructions for producing the proteins exostosin-1 and exostosin-2, respectively. The two exostosin proteins bind together and form a complex found in a cell structure called the Golgi apparatus, which modifies newly produced enzymes and other proteins. In the Golgi apparatus, the exostosin-1 and exostosin-2 complex modifies a protein called heparan sulfate so it can be used by the cell.  When there is a mutation in exostosin-1 or exostosin-2, heparan sulfate cannot be processed correctly and is nonfunctional. Although heparan sulfate is involved in many bodily processes, it is unclear how the lack of this protein contributes to the development of osteochondromas.  If the condition is caused by a mutation in the EXT1 gene it is called hereditary multiple osteochondromas type 1. A mutation in the EXT2 gene causes hereditary multiple osteochondromas type 2. While both type 1 and type 2 involve multiple osteochondromas, mutations in the EXT1 gene likely account for 55 to 75 percent of all cases of hereditary multiple osteochondromas, and the severity of symptoms associated with osteochondromas seems to be greater in type 1.  Researchers estimate that about 15 percent of people with hereditary multiple osteochondromas have no mutation in either the EXT1 or the EXT2 gene. It is not known why multiple osteochondromas form in these individuals."

However, it does discuss peroxisomal disorders, which can be related to hyperlysinemia. \n\nHyperlysinemia is a condition characterized by elevated levels of lysine in the blood, and it can be caused by a defect in the enzyme alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase, which is involved in lysine degradation. This enzyme is located in the peroxisome.\n\nThe genetic changes related to hyperlysinemia are typically autosomal recessive, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the condition. The specific genetic mutations associated with hyperlysinemia are usually point mutations or deletions in the gene that codes for the alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase enzyme, such as the AASS gene.",
    "ground_truth": "Mutations in the AASS gene cause hyperlysinemia. The AASS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase. This enzyme performs two functions in the breakdown of lysine. First, the enzyme breaks down lysine to a molecule called saccharopine. It then breaks down saccharopine to a molecule called alpha-aminoadipate semialdehyde.  Mutations in the AASS gene that impair the breakdown of lysine result in elevated levels of lysine in the blood and urine. These increased levels of lysine do not appear to have any negative effects on the body.  When mutations in the AASS gene impair the breakdown of saccharopine, this molecule builds up in blood and urine. This buildup is sometimes referred to as saccharopinuria, which is considered to be a variant of hyperlysinemia. It is unclear if saccharopinuria causes any symptoms."

Liddle syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the SCNN1A, SCNN1B, or SCNN1G genes. These genes provide instructions for making parts of a protein called the epithelial sodium channel, which is involved in sodium balance in the body. The mutations that cause Liddle syndrome lead to overactivity of this channel, resulting in excessive sodium reabsorption and potassium loss, which can cause high blood pressure, hypokalemia (low potassium levels), and metabolic alkalosis (elevated blood pH).",
    "ground_truth": "Liddle syndrome is caused by mutations in the SCNN1B or SCNN1G gene. Each of these genes provides instructions for making a piece (subunit) of a protein complex called the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). These channels are found at the surface of certain cells called epithelial cells in many tissues of the body, including the kidneys, where the channels transport sodium into cells.  In the kidney, ENaC channels open in response to signals that sodium levels in the blood are too low, which allows sodium to flow into cells. From the kidney cells, this sodium is returned to the bloodstream (a process called reabsorption) rather than being removed from the body in urine.  Mutations in the SCNN1B or SCNN1G gene change the structure of the respective ENaC subunit. The changes alter a region of the subunit that is involved in signaling for its breakdown (degradation) when it is no longer needed. As a result of the mutations, the subunit proteins are not degraded, and more ENaC channels remain at the cell surface. The increase in channels at the cell surface abnormally increases the reabsorption of sodium (followed by water), which leads to hypertension. Reabsorption of sodium into the blood is linked with removal of potassium from the blood, so excess sodium reabsorption leads to hypokalemia."

Enteroccocci are bacteria that are normally present in the human intestines and in the female genital tract and are often found in the environment. These bacteria can sometimes cause infections. Vancomycin is an antibiotic that is used to treat some drug-resistant infections caused by enterococci. In some instances, enterococci have become resistant to this drug and thus are called vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Most VRE infections occur in hospitals. Top of page What types of infections does VRE cause? VRE can live in the human intestines and female genital tract without causing disease (often called colonization). However, sometimes it can cause infections of the urinary tract, the bloodstream, or of wounds associated with catheters or surgical procedures. Top of page Are certain people at risk of getting VRE?

People with colonized VRE (bacteria are present, but have no symptoms of an infection)  do not need treatment. Most VRE infections can be treated with antibiotics other than vancomycin. Laboratory testing of the VRE can determine which antibiotics will work. For people who get VRE infections in their bladder and have urinary catheters, removal of the catheter when it is no longer needed can also help get rid of the infection. Top of page How is VRE spread? VRE is often passed from person to person by the contaminated hands of caregivers. VRE can get onto a caregiver's hands after they have contact with other people with VRE or after contact with contaminated surfaces. VRE can also be spread directly to people after they touch surfaces that are contaminated with VRE. VRE is not spread through the air by coughing or sneezing.

    "model_answer": "Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a condition that affects the heart's electrical system, specifically the repolarization phase. It is characterized by a prolongation of the QT interval, which can predispose individuals to arrhythmias, particularly torsades de pointes, due to early after-depolarizations and spatial dispersion of refractoriness.\n\nThere are at least 10 distinct forms of congenital Long QT syndrome, with the most common ones being:\n\n1. Long QT syndrome type 1 (LQT1): caused by a loss of function mutation of the KCNQ1 gene, which encodes an adrenergic-sensitive cardiac K current (I_Ks).\n\nIn general, Long QT syndrome can be congenital (inherited) or acquired (caused by certain medications, electrolyte imbalances, or other medical conditions). It is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires proper diagnosis and treatment to prevent sudden cardiac death.",
    "ground_truth": "Long QT syndrome is a disorder of the hearts electrical activity that can cause sudden, uncontrollable, and irregular heartbeats (arrhythmia), which may lead to sudden death. Long QT syndrome can be detected by electrocardiogram (EKG). It can be caused by a variety of different gene mutations (changes). It can also be acquired (noninherited) and may be brought on by certain medicines and other medical conditions."

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available.

    "question": "What is (are) autosomal dominant hypocalcemia ?",
    "model_answer": "Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia, also known as autosomal dominant hypoparathyroidism, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by low calcium levels in the blood (hypocalcemia) due to impaired parathyroid gland function. It is typically caused by mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) gene.\n\nIn autosomal dominant hypocalcemia, the parathyroid glands are often normal or slightly enlarged, but they are less responsive to low calcium levels, leading to inadequate parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. This results in hypocalcemia, which can cause a range of symptoms, including muscle cramps, tingling, and seizures.\n\nThe condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the disorder. This means that each child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene and developing the condition.\n\nThere are three types of autosomal dominant hypocalcemia, which are distinguished by the underlying genetic cause:\n\n1. Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1: caused by gain-of-function mutations in the CASR gene.\n2. Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 2: caused by loss-of-function mutations in the GNA11 gene.\n3. Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 3: caused by mutations in the AP2S1 gene.\n\nTreatment for autosomal dominant hypocalcemia typically involves calcium and vitamin D supplementation to manage hypocalcemia and prevent complications.",
    "ground_truth": "Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia is characterized by low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia). Affected individuals can have an imbalance of other molecules in the blood as well, including too much phosphate (hyperphosphatemia) or too little magnesium (hypomagnesemia). Some people with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia also have low levels of a hormone called parathyroid hormone (hypoparathyroidism). This hormone is involved in the regulation of calcium levels in the blood. Abnormal levels of calcium and other molecules in the body can lead to a variety of signs and symptoms, although about half of affected individuals have no associated health problems.  The most common features of autosomal dominant hypocalcemia include muscle spasms in the hands and feet (carpopedal spasms) and muscle cramping, prickling or tingling sensations (paresthesias), or twitching of the nerves and muscles (neuromuscular irritability) in various parts of the body. More severely affected individuals develop seizures, usually in infancy or childhood. Sometimes, these symptoms occur only during episodes of illness or fever.  Some people with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia have high levels of calcium in their urine (hypercalciuria), which can lead to deposits of calcium in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis) or the formation of kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). These conditions can damage the kidneys and impair their function. Sometimes, abnormal deposits of calcium form in the brain, typically in structures called basal ganglia, which help control movement.  A small percentage of severely affected individuals have features of a kidney disorder called Bartter syndrome in addition to hypocalcemia. These features can include a shortage of potassium (hypokalemia) and magnesium and a buildup of the hormone aldosterone (hyperaldosteronism) in the blood. The abnormal balance of molecules can raise the pH of the blood, which is known as metabolic alkalosis. The combination of features of these two conditions is sometimes referred to as autosomal dominant hypocalcemia with Bartter syndrome or Bartter syndrome type V.  There are two types of autosomal dominant hypocalcemia distinguished by their genetic cause. The signs and symptoms of the two types are generally the same."

Some areas of focus include:\n\n1. **Immunotherapy**: Studies are investigating the use of immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, to treat TCC of the renal pelvis and ureter. These therapies aim to enhance the body's immune response against cancer cells.\n2. **Targeted therapies**: Researchers are exploring targeted therapies that specifically target molecular abnormalities in TCC cells. For example, studies are investigating the use of inhibitors of the FGFR3 gene, which is often mutated in TCC.\n3. **Minimally invasive surgical techniques**: Clinical trials are evaluating the effectiveness of minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as laparoscopic and robotic surgery, for the treatment of TCC of the renal pelvis and ureter.\n4. **Intravesical therapy**: Researchers are investigating the use of intravesical therapy, where a drug is directly administered into the renal pelvis or ureter, to treat TCC. This approach aims to reduce the risk of recurrence and improve treatment outcomes.\n5. **Biomarker discovery**: Studies are focused on identifying biomarkers that can help diagnose TCC of the renal pelvis and ureter at an early stage, as well as predict treatment response and patient outcomes.\n6. **Combination therapies**: Clinical trials are evaluating the effectiveness of combining different treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, to improve treatment outcomes for patients with TCC of the renal pelvis and ureter.\n7. **Personalized medicine**: Researchers are working to develop personalized treatment approaches based on the unique genetic and molecular characteristics of each patient's tumor.\n\nSome ongoing clinical trials for TCC of the renal pelvis and ureter include:\n\n* NCT03656414: A phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (an immunotherapy) in patients with advanced TCC of the renal pelvis and ureter.\n* NCT03390505: A phase I/II trial investigating the use of a targeted therapy (erdafitinib) in patients with TCC of the renal pelvis and ureter harboring FGFR3 mutations.\n* NCT03124259: A phase III trial comparing the efficacy and safety of minimally invasive surgery versus open surgery for the treatment of TCC of the renal pelvis and ureter.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the ongoing research and clinical trials for TCC of the renal pelvis and ureter.

Fulguration     Fulguration is a surgical procedure that destroys tissue using an electric current. A tool with a small wire loop on the end is used to remove the cancer or to burn away the tumor with electricity.       Segmental resection of the renal pelvis    This is a surgical procedure to remove localized cancer from the renal pelvis without removing the entire kidney. Segmental resection may be done to save kidney function when the other kidney is damaged or has already been removed.

This procedure may also be called or laser fulguration.       Regional chemotherapy and regional biologic therapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer; substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. Regional treatment means the anticancer drugs or biologic substances are placed directly into an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen, so the drugs will affect cancer cells in that area.

Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.

    "question": "Is heterotaxy syndrome inherited ?",
    "model_answer": "Heterotaxy syndrome is a complex condition that involves abnormalities in the arrangement of organs in the body. While it can be inherited in some cases, it is not always the case.\n\nResearch suggests that heterotaxy syndrome can be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some people with heterotaxy syndrome may have a family history of the condition, which suggests that there may be a genetic component. However, many cases of heterotaxy syndrome occur sporadically, without a known family history.\n\nIn some cases, heterotaxy syndrome has been linked to genetic mutations or chromosomal abnormalities, such as uniparental disomy or chromosomal translocation. For example, uniparental disomy, where a person receives two copies of a chromosome from the same parent, can increase the risk of heterotaxy syndrome. Additionally, chromosomal translocations, which involve the exchange of genetic material between chromosomes, can also contribute to the development of heterotaxy syndrome.\n\nIt's estimated that about 10-20% of cases of heterotaxy syndrome are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition. However, the majority of cases are thought to be sporadic, and the exact causes are still not fully understood.\n\nIf you have a family history of heterotaxy syndrome or are concerned about your risk of developing the condition, it's best to speak with a genetic counselor or a healthcare professional for personalized advice and guidance.",
    "ground_truth": "Most often, heterotaxy syndrome is sporadic, meaning that only one person in a family is affected. However, about 10 percent of people with heterotaxy syndrome have a close relative (such as a parent or sibling) who has a congenital heart defect without other apparent features of heterotaxy syndrome. Isolated congenital heart defects and heterotaxy syndrome may represent a range of signs and symptoms that can result from a particular genetic mutation; this situation is known as variable expressivity. It is also possible that different genetic and environmental factors combine to produce isolated congenital heart defects in some family members and heterotaxy syndrome in others.  When heterotaxy syndrome runs in families, it can have an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked pattern of inheritance, depending on which gene is involved. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Autosomal recessive inheritance means that both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. In X-linked inheritance, the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes in each cell.  When heterotaxy syndrome occurs as a feature of primary ciliary dyskinesia, it has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance."

This suggests that the healthcare provider is trying to assess the patient's salivary gland function and identify potential causes of dry mouth.",
    "ground_truth": "People get dry mouth when the glands in the mouth that make saliva are not working properly. Because of this, there might not be enough saliva to keep your mouth healthy. There are several reasons why these glands, called salivary glands, might not work right. Medicines and Dry Mouth More than 400 medicines, including some over-the-counter medications, can cause the salivary glands to make less saliva, or to change the composition of the saliva so that it can't perform the functions it should. As an example, medicines for urinary incontinence, allergies, high blood pressure, and depression often cause dry mouth. Diseases That Can Cause Dry Mouth Some diseases can affect the salivary glands. Dry mouth can occur in patients with diabetes. Dry mouth is also the hallmark symptom of the fairly common autoimmune disease Sjgren's syndrome. Sjgren's syndrome can occur either by itself or with another autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Salivary and tear glands are the major targets of the syndrome and the result is a decrease in production of saliva and tears. The disorder can occur at any age, but the average person with the disorder at the Sjgren's Syndrome Clinic of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) is in his or her late 50s. Women with the disorder outnumber men 9 to 1. Cancer Treatments and Dry Mouth Certain cancer treatments can affect the salivary glands. Head and neck radiation therapy can cause the glands to produce little or no saliva. Chemotherapy may cause the salivary glands to produce thicker saliva, which makes the mouth feel dry and sticky. Injury to the head or neck can damage the nerves that tell salivary glands to make saliva."

However, based on general medical knowledge:\n\nComplete LCAT deficiency is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a complete lack of functional Lecithin-Cholesterol Acyltransferase (LCAT), an enzyme crucial for cholesterol esterification and the formation of high-density lipoproteins (HDL). This deficiency leads to abnormal lipoprotein profiles, including very low levels of HDL cholesterol and high levels of unesterified cholesterol in the blood.\n\nClinical features of complete LCAT deficiency can include:\n\n1. **Severe hypertriglyceridemia**: Elevated levels of triglycerides in the blood.\n2. **Low HDL cholesterol**: Significantly reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\n3. **Renal disease**: Potential for kidney damage or disease due to lipid accumulation.\n4. **Corneal opacities**: Deposits of lipids in the cornea, which can affect vision.\n\nIt's worth noting that there are two forms of LCAT deficiency: complete and partial (or fish-eye disease). The complete form is more severe and affects both alpha and beta activities of the enzyme, while the partial form primarily affects the alpha activity.",
    "ground_truth": "Complete LCAT deficiency is a disorder that primarily affects the eyes and kidneys.  In complete LCAT deficiency, the clear front surface of the eyes (the corneas) gradually becomes cloudy. The cloudiness, which generally first appears in early childhood, consists of small grayish dots of cholesterol (opacities) distributed across the corneas. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is produced in the body and obtained from foods that come from animals; it aids in many functions of the body but can become harmful in excessive amounts. As complete LCAT deficiency progresses, the corneal cloudiness worsens and can lead to severely impaired vision.  People with complete LCAT deficiency often have kidney disease that begins in adolescence or early adulthood. The kidney problems get worse over time and may eventually lead to kidney failure. Individuals with this disorder also usually have a condition known as hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells are broken down (undergo hemolysis) prematurely, resulting in a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Anemia can cause pale skin, weakness, fatigue, and more serious complications.  Other features of complete LCAT deficiency that occur in some affected individuals include enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly), spleen (splenomegaly), or lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) or an accumulation of fatty deposits on the artery walls (atherosclerosis)."

    "ground_truth": "Summary : Diabetes means your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. If you can't control your diabetes with wise food choices and physical activity, you may need diabetes medicines. The kind of medicine you take depends on your type of diabetes, your schedule, and your other health conditions.     With type 1 diabetes, your pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much glucose stays in your blood. If you have type 1 diabetes, you will need to take insulin.     Type 2 diabetes, the most common type, can start when the body doesn't use insulin as it should. If your body can't keep up with the need for insulin, you may need to take pills. Along with meal planning and physical activity, diabetes pills help people with type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes keep their blood glucose levels on target. Several kinds of pills are available. Each works in a different way. Many people take two or three kinds of pills. Some people take combination pills. Combination pills contain two kinds of diabetes medicine in one tablet. Some people take pills and insulin.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"

It discusses the diagnosis and treatment of a throat cyst and Velopharyngeal Insufficiency. \n\nHowever, I can provide general information on how to diagnose Tracheobronchomalacia. Tracheobronchomalacia is a condition characterized by the softening or weakening of the cartilage in the trachea and bronchi. Diagnosis is typically made using a combination of the following methods:\n\n1. Bronchoscopy: A flexible or rigid bronchoscope is used to visualize the airways and assess the trachea and bronchi for signs of malacia, such as collapse or narrowing.\n2. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs): These tests measure lung function and can help identify abnormalities in airflow.\n3. Imaging studies: Computed Tomography (CT) scans or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) may be used to evaluate the airways and surrounding structures.\n4. Fluoroscopy: This imaging technique can be used to visualize the trachea and bronchi in real-time, allowing for assessment of airway collapse during breathing.\n\nA definitive diagnosis of Tracheobronchomalacia is often made based on the results of these diagnostic tests, as well as a thorough medical history and physical examination.",
    "ground_truth": "How is tracheobronchomalacia diagnosed? A diagnosis of tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) may be suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms or abnormal pulmonary function tests. Additional testing such as CT scan and bronchoscopy can then be performed to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate the severity of the condition. TBM is considered mild if the trachea narrows to 50% of its initial size while the affected person is breathing out, moderate if it narrows to 25%, and severe if the walls of the trachea touch."

    "question": "What causes Mosaic trisomy 9 ?",
    "model_answer": "The text doesn't mention Mosaic trisomy 9. It actually talks about a reciprocal translocation between the long arm of chromosome 9 and the long arm of chromosome 22, denoted as t(9;22), which is associated with a condition, likely Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) or a similar disorder. \n\nMosaic trisomy 9 is a different condition, where there's an extra copy of chromosome 9 in some cells of the body. The cause of Mosaic trisomy 9 is usually a random error during cell division, which can occur in the formation of reproductive cells or in early fetal development. This error results in an extra copy of chromosome 9 in some cells, while other cells have the typical 46 chromosomes.",
    "ground_truth": "What causes mosaic trisomy 9? Most cases of mosaic trisomy 9 occur due to a random event during the formation of the reproductive cells (egg and sperm) or after fertilization has taken place. An error in cell division (called nondisjunction) may cause some eggs or sperm to have an abnormal number of chromosomes. If an egg or sperm with an extra chromosome 9 contributes to the genetic makeup of an embryo, the embryo will have an extra copy of chromosome 9 in each cell. As the embryo grows and divides, an attempt may be made to correct the mistake by eliminating one extra chromosome 9. In people with mosaic trisomy 9, this attempt may be partly successful, leaving some cells with an extra chromosome 9 and some cells with the extra chromosome deleted (the usual chromosome number). This correction process is called trisomy rescue. In other cases, the egg and sperm may have a normal number of chromosomes, but an error of cell division (nondisjunction) occurs when the fertilized egg is growing and dividing. If an error occurs during one of the divisions, it can cause some cells to have an abnormal number of chromosomes. In people affected by mosaic trisomy 9, some of the body's cells have the usual two copies of chromosome 9, and other cells have three copies of this chromosome (trisomy). The percentage of cells with trisomy 9 and which parts of the body are affected vary from person to person. This leads to variability in the range and severity of symptoms. In rare cases, mosaic trisomy 9 is inherited from a parent with a chromosomal rearrangement called a \"pericentric inversion.\" This occurs when a segment of chromosome 9 has broken off in two places, swiveled round 180 degrees and reinserted itself into the chromosome. If this rearrangement is considered \"balanced,\" meaning the piece of chromosome is in a different order but no genetic material is gained or lost, it usually does not cause any symptoms or health problems. However, it can be associated with an increased risk of having children with an abnormal number or chromosomes."

This suggests that pregnancy can be a trigger or an indicator of an increased risk of developing diabetes later in life, especially for women who have had gestational diabetes.",
    "ground_truth": "Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. When you are pregnant, high blood sugar levels are not good for your baby.    About seven out of every 100 pregnant women in the United States get gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes is diabetes that happens for the first time when a woman is pregnant. Most of the time, it goes away after you have your baby. But it does increase your risk for developing type 2 diabetes later on. Your child is also at risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes.    Most women get a test to check for diabetes during their second trimester of pregnancy. Women at higher risk may get a test earlier.    If you already have diabetes, the best time to control your blood sugar is before you get pregnant. High blood sugar levels can be harmful to your baby during the first weeks of pregnancy - even before you know you are pregnant. To keep you and your baby healthy, it is important to keep your blood sugar as close to normal as possible before and during pregnancy.    Either type of diabetes during pregnancy increases the chances of problems for you and your baby. To help lower the chances talk to your health care team about       - A meal plan for your pregnancy    - A safe exercise plan    - How often to test your blood sugar    - Taking your medicine as prescribed.

    "question": "What are the treatments for Arginase deficiency ?",
    "model_answer": "Arginase deficiency, also known as argininemia, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the urea cycle. The primary treatment goals for arginase deficiency are to:\n\n1. **Reduce arginine levels**: This can be achieved through a **low-protein diet** or a **protein-restricted diet**, which helps to decrease the amount of arginine produced in the body.\n2. **Supplement with alternative amino acids**: Providing alternative amino acids, such as citrulline or arginine-free amino acid supplements, can help to promote growth and development while minimizing arginine intake.\n3. **Use of arginine-reducing medications**: Medications like sodium benzoate or sodium phenylbutyrate can help to reduce arginine levels by increasing the excretion of arginine in the urine.\n4. **Symptomatic treatment**: Managing symptoms such as spasticity, seizures, and intellectual disability may require additional medications and therapies, such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy.\n5. **Lifelong monitoring**: Regular monitoring of arginine levels, ammonia levels, and overall health is crucial to ensure that the treatment plan is effective and to make adjustments as needed.\n\nIt's essential to note that each individual with arginase deficiency may require a personalized treatment plan, and a healthcare professional should be consulted to determine the best course of treatment.",
    "ground_truth": "How might arginase deficiency be treated? The treatment and management of arginase deficiency is generally focused on lowering arginine levels and preventing hyperammonemia (an accumulation of ammonia in the blood). This may be accomplished through dietary modifications and the use of certain medications (called nitrogen-scavenging drugs) under the supervision of a medical team with experience treating metabolic conditions. More specifically, people affected by arginase deficiency must restrict dietary protein and arginine. This is often achieved with the use of specialized formulas, which may account for half or more of protein intake. Although people with arginase deficiency are less prone to episodes of severe hyperammonemia than people affected by other urea cycle disorders, special treatment is needed should these episodes occur. During an episode, affected people are generally treated in the hospital and may require dialysis, nitrogen-scavenging medications, intravenous (IV) fluids/feeds and/or other treatments. These treatments are administered with the goal of rapidly reducing blood ammonia levels and preventing neurological damage.

    "ground_truth": "Dopa-responsive dystonia is a disorder that involves involuntary muscle contractions, tremors, and other uncontrolled movements (dystonia). The features of this condition range from mild to severe. This form of dystonia is called dopa-responsive dystonia because the signs and symptoms typically improve with sustained use of a medication known as L-Dopa.  Signs and symptoms of dopa-responsive dystonia usually appear during childhood, most commonly around age 6. The first signs of the condition are typically the development of inward- and upward-turning feet (clubfeet) and dystonia in the lower limbs. The dystonia spreads to the upper limbs over time; beginning in adolescence, the whole body is typically involved. Affected individuals may have unusual limb positioning and a lack of coordination when walking or running. Some people with this condition have sleep problems or episodes of depression more frequently than would normally be expected.  Over time, affected individuals often develop a group of movement abnormalities called parkinsonism. These abnormalities include unusually slow movement (bradykinesia), muscle rigidity, tremors, and an inability to hold the body upright and balanced (postural instability).  The movement difficulties associated with dopa-responsive dystonia usually worsen with age but stabilize around age 30. A characteristic feature of dopa-responsive dystonia is worsening of movement problems later in the day and an improvement of symptoms in the morning, after sleep (diurnal fluctuation).  Rarely, the movement problems associated with dopa-responsive dystonia do not appear until adulthood. In these adult-onset cases, parkinsonism usually develops before dystonia, and movement problems are slow to worsen and do not show diurnal fluctuations."

Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

    "question": "What are the treatments for Anxiety Disorders ?",
    "model_answer": "As a medical assistant, I'd like to provide you with information on the treatments for Anxiety Disorders. While the provided context doesn't explicitly mention treatments, I can give you an overview of common approaches based on general medical knowledge.\n\nTreatments for Anxiety Disorders typically involve a combination of the following:\n\n1. **Psychotherapy**: Also known as talk therapy, this involves working with a mental health professional to address underlying thoughts, feelings, and behaviors contributing to anxiety. Common types of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders include:\n\t* Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)\n\t* Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)\n\t* Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)\n2. **Medications**: Various medications can help alleviate anxiety symptoms, including:\n\t* Benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, clonazepam)\n\t* Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline)\n\t* Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, e.g., venlafaxine)\n\t* Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)\n3. **Lifestyle Changes**: Making healthy lifestyle choices can help manage anxiety, such as:\n\t* Regular exercise\n\t* Balanced diet\n\t* Adequate sleep\n\t* Stress management techniques (e.g., meditation, deep breathing, yoga)\n4. **Relaxation Techniques**: These can help reduce anxiety symptoms, including:\n\t* Progressive muscle relaxation\n\t* Visualization\n\t* Mindfulness meditation\n5. **Support Groups**: Joining a support group can provide a sense of community and connection with others who are experiencing similar struggles.\n\nIt's essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional to determine the best course of treatment for a specific anxiety disorder. They will work with you to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses your unique needs and circumstances.",
    "ground_truth": "Exposure-based treatment has been used for many years to treat specific phobias. The person gradually encounters the object or situation that is feared, perhaps at first only through pictures or tapes, then later face-to-face. Sometimes the therapist will accompany the person to a feared situation to provide support and guidance. Exposure exercises are undertaken once the patient decides he is ready for it and with his cooperation. To be effective, therapy must be directed at the persons specific anxieties and must be tailored to his or her needs. A typical side effect is temporary discomfort involved with thinking about confronting feared situations."

    "question": "Is Essential tremor inherited ?",
    "model_answer": "Yes, essential tremor is sometimes an inherited condition.",
    "ground_truth": "Is essential tremor inherited? About half of all cases of essential tremor appear to occur because of a genetic mutation. This is referred to as familial tremor. In these cases, essential tremor appears to be passed through generations in families, but the inheritance pattern varies. In many affected families, the condition appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In other families, the inheritance pattern is unclear. Essential tremor may also appear in people with no history of the disorder in their family. In some families, there are individuals who have essential tremor while others have other movement disorders, such as involuntary muscle tensing (dystonia). The potential genetic connection between essential tremor and other movement disorders is an active area of research.."

    "question": "What are the genetic changes related to hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia ?",
    "model_answer": "The text you provided doesn't mention hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia. It talks about primary hemochromatosis, which is related to mutations in the HFE gene, among other possible causes.\n\nHowever, I can provide information on hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) if that's what you're looking for. HED is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormalities in the development of teeth, hair, and sweat glands. The genetic changes related to HED are typically mutations in the EDA, EDAR, or EDARADD genes, which code for proteins involved in the development of ectodermal tissues. These mutations can be inherited in an X-linked or autosomal recessive pattern.",
    "ground_truth": "Mutations in the EDA, EDAR, and EDARADD genes cause hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia.  The EDA, EDAR, and EDARADD genes provide instructions for making proteins that work together during embryonic development. These proteins form part of a signaling pathway that is critical for the interaction between two cell layers, the ectoderm and the mesoderm. In the early embryo, these cell layers form the basis for many of the body's organs and tissues. Ectoderm-mesoderm interactions are essential for the formation of several structures that arise from the ectoderm, including the skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands.  Mutations in the EDA, EDAR, or EDARADD gene prevent normal interactions between the ectoderm and the mesoderm and impair the normal development of hair, sweat glands, and teeth. The improper formation of these ectodermal structures leads to the characteristic features of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia."

    "question": "What are the stages of Breast Cancer ?",
    "model_answer": "The stages of breast cancer are typically classified into five stages, from 0 to IV, based on the size of the tumor, whether the cancer has spread to lymph nodes, and whether it has metastasized to other parts of the body. Here are the stages of breast cancer:\n\n**Stage 0:** \n- Carcinoma in situ, which means the cancer is confined to the ducts or lobules and has not invaded surrounding tissue.\n- No evidence of cancer cells in the lymph nodes or distant sites.\n\n**Stage I:**\n- The tumor is small (less than 2 cm) and has not spread to lymph nodes or distant sites.\n- Cancer cells may be present in up to 3 lymph nodes under the arm.\n\n**Stage II:**\n- The tumor is larger (2-5 cm) and may have spread to up to 3 lymph nodes under the arm.\n- Alternatively, the tumor may be smaller, but cancer cells are found in 4 or more lymph nodes under the arm.\n\n**Stage III:**\n- The tumor is larger (greater than 5 cm) and has spread to more lymph nodes under the arm, or to lymph nodes above the collarbone.\n- The cancer may have also spread to the chest wall or skin of the breast.\n\n**Stage IV (Metastatic):**\n- The cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, such as the bones, liver, lungs, or brain.\n- This stage is also known as metastatic breast cancer.\n\nIt's worth noting that the specific characteristics of the cancer, such as hormone receptor status (estrogen and progesterone receptors) and HER2 protein status, can also influence treatment decisions and prognosis.",
    "ground_truth": "Key Points\n                    - After breast cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the body.     - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.    - The following stages are used for breast cancer:         - Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)     - Stage I      - Stage II     - Stage IIIA     - Stage IIIB     - Stage IIIC     - Stage IV        - The treatment of breast cancer depends partly on the stage of the disease.\n                \n                \n                    After breast cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the body.\n                    The process used to find out whether the cancer has spread within the breast or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The results of some of the tests used to diagnose breast cancer are also used to stage the disease. (See the General Information section.)    The following tests and procedures also may be used in the staging process:         -   Sentinel lymph node biopsy : The removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes.     -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\n                \n                \n                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\n                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.\n                \n                \n                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\n                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if breast cancer spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually breast cancer cells. The disease is metastatic breast cancer, not bone cancer.\n                \n                \n                    The following stages are used for breast cancer:\n                    This section describes the stages of breast cancer. The breast cancer stage is based on the results of tests that are done on the tumor and lymph nodes removed during surgery and on other tests.     Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)    There are 3 types of breast carcinoma in situ:            -  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a noninvasive condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lining of a breast duct. The abnormal cells have not spread outside the duct to other tissues in the breast. In some cases, DCIS may become invasive cancer and spread to other tissues. At this time, there is no way to know which lesions could become invasive.     -  Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lobules of the breast. This condition seldom becomes invasive cancer. Information about LCIS is not included in this summary.     -  Paget disease of the nipple is a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the nipple only.               Stage I      In stage I, cancer has formed. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB.            - In stage IA, the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller. Cancer has not spread outside the breast.     - In stage IB, small clusters of breast cancer cells (larger than 0.2 millimeter but not larger than 2 millimeters) are found in the lymph nodes and either:                  - no tumor is found in the breast; or       - the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller.                         Stage II     Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB.            - In stage IIA:                  - no tumor is found in the breast or the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller. Cancer (larger than 2 millimeters) is found in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or in the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during a sentinel lymph node biopsy); or        - the tumor is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters. Cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes.                - In stage IIB, the tumor is:                  - larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters. Small clusters of breast cancer cells (larger than 0.2 millimeter but not larger than 2 millimeters) are found in the lymph nodes; or        - larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters. Cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or to the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during a sentinel lymph node biopsy); or        - larger than 5 centimeters. Cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes.                          Stage IIIA     In stage IIIA:            - no tumor is found in the breast or the tumor may be any size. Cancer is found in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes or in the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during imaging tests or a physical exam); or      - the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters. Small clusters of breast cancer cells (larger than 0.2 millimeter but not larger than 2 millimeters) are found in the lymph nodes; or      - the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters. Cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or to the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during a sentinel lymph node biopsy).               Stage IIIB     In stage IIIB, the tumor may be any size and cancer has spread to the chest wall and/or to the skin of the breast and caused swelling or an ulcer. Also, cancer may have spread to:             - up to 9 axillary lymph nodes; or     - the lymph nodes near the breastbone.           Cancer that has spread to the skin of the breast may also be inflammatory breast cancer. See the section on Inflammatory Breast Cancer for more information.       Stage IIIC     In stage IIIC, no tumor is found in the breast or the tumor may be any size. Cancer may have spread to the skin of the breast and caused swelling or an ulcer and/or has spread to the chest wall. Also, cancer has spread to:             - 10 or more axillary lymph nodes; or     -  lymph nodes above or below the collarbone; or     - axillary lymph nodes and lymph nodes near the breastbone.           Cancer that has spread to the skin of the breast may also be inflammatory breast cancer. See the section on Inflammatory Breast Cancer for more information.       Stage IV     In stage IV, cancer has spread to other organs of the body, most often the bones, lungs, liver, or brain.\n                \n                \n                    The treatment of breast cancer depends partly on the stage of the disease.\n                    For ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treatment options, see Ductal Carcinoma in Situ.

    "question": "What is (are) GM2-gangliosidosis, AB variant ?",
    "model_answer": "The AB variant of GM2-gangliosidosis is a rare form of the disease, also known as Sandhoff's disease. It is caused by a deficiency of both hexosaminidase A (Hex-A) and hexosaminidase B (Hex-B) enzymes, which are necessary for breaking down GM2 gangliosides in the brain.\n\nIn the AB variant, there is a mutation in the gene that codes for the beta-subunit of hexosaminidase, which is a shared subunit between Hex-A and Hex-B. As a result, both enzymes are deficient, leading to the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides in the brain and causing severe neurologic symptoms.\n\nSandhoff's disease is similar to Tay-Sachs disease, but it is more severe and has an earlier onset. It is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, seizures, and early death, usually in early childhood.",
    "ground_truth": "GM2-gangliosidosis, AB variant is a rare inherited disorder that progressively destroys nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and spinal cord.  Signs and symptoms of the AB variant become apparent in infancy. Infants with this disorder typically appear normal until the age of 3 to 6 months, when their development slows and muscles used for movement weaken. Affected infants lose motor skills such as turning over, sitting, and crawling. They also develop an exaggerated startle reaction to loud noises. As the disease progresses, children with the AB variant experience seizures, vision and hearing loss, intellectual disability, and paralysis. An eye abnormality called a cherry-red spot, which can be identified with an eye examination, is characteristic of this disorder. Children with the AB variant usually live only into early childhood."

It is often associated with woolly or fragile hair, particularly in infancy and early childhood. This condition can be further divided into several subtypes, including:\n\n1. Naxos disease: A recessive disorder featuring woolly hair, keratoderma, and a high risk of cardiac problems.\n2. Carvajal syndrome: A similar condition with woolly hair, keratoderma, and heart issues, but with a distinct set of genetic mutations.\n\nBoth conditions are extremely rare and often require a comprehensive evaluation, including genetic testing, to confirm the diagnosis.",
    "ground_truth": "Keratoderma with woolly hair is a group of related conditions that affect the skin and hair and in many cases increase the risk of potentially life-threatening heart problems. People with these conditions have hair that is unusually coarse, dry, fine, and tightly curled. In some cases, the hair is also sparse. The woolly hair texture typically affects only scalp hair and is present from birth. Starting early in life, affected individuals also develop palmoplantar keratoderma, a condition that causes skin on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet to become thick, scaly, and calloused.  Cardiomyopathy, which is a disease of the heart muscle, is a life-threatening health problem that can develop in people with keratoderma with woolly hair. Unlike the other features of this condition, signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy may not appear until adolescence or later. Complications of cardiomyopathy can include an abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia), heart failure, and sudden death.  Keratoderma with woolly hair comprises several related conditions with overlapping signs and symptoms. Researchers have recently proposed classifying keratoderma with woolly hair into four types, based on the underlying genetic cause. Type I, also known as Naxos disease, is characterized by palmoplantar keratoderma, woolly hair, and a form of cardiomyopathy called arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Type II, also known as Carvajal syndrome, has hair and skin abnormalities similar to type I but features a different form of cardiomyopathy, called dilated left ventricular cardiomyopathy. Type III also has signs and symptoms similar to those of type I, including ARVC, although the hair and skin abnormalities are often milder. Type IV is characterized by palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly and sparse hair, as well as abnormal fingernails and toenails. Type IV does not appear to cause cardiomyopathy."
